# DND-Service-Implementation

The goal of this project is to implement DND (Do Not Disturb) Services using **Socket Programming**.

* With this service, subscriber can block/stop unwanted calls.
* The subscriber can activate the DND service either at **Global level** or at **Selective level**.
* In case of Global, the subscriber will not receive any call, while in case of Selective, he will not receive any call from the selected number or the selected groups.
* Once the DND service is activated, the subscriber would be informed via a confirmation message. 
* There will be provision for deactivating the DND service, once deactivated; the subscriber will receive all the incoming calls.
